//React router steps:

first install via npm:
- npm i react-router
- npm i react-router-dom

on main.tsx file:

import {BrowserRouter} from 'react-router-dom';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <App />
    </BrowserRouter>
  </React.StrictMode>,
)

//on other files where react router is to be implemented:

import {Routes, Route} from 'react-router-dom'

import Home from './routes/home/home.component'

const App = () => {

  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />}/>
    </Routes>
  )
}

export default App

//the authentication inside firebase is a separate service from firestore database
